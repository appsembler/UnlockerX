UnlockerX
=========

|travis-badge| |codecov-badge| |doc-badge|

An app to manage (and remove) both student-specific and IP-based locks in the Open edX platform.

Overview
--------
The edX Platform has two types of security rate limits to avoid
stealing user passwords using brute-force attacks:

- **IP-based rate limits:** Using `django-ratelimit-backend <https://github.com/brutasse/django-ratelimit-backend>`_
  to rate-limit subsequent incorrect requests and block the requester IP address for a period of time. IP-based locks
  are stored on the cache backend.
- **Student-account locks:** This an *optional* edX platform feature. It works on the login screen and locks
  user-accounts (regardless of the IP address) for a period of time. Student-locks are stored on the ``LoginFailure``
  model (in the database).

UnlockerX stores the IP-based rate limits in the database once a lock occurs in ``RateLimitedIP`` model. Additionally
UnlockerX exposes both of ``LoginFailure`` and ``RateLimitedIP`` in an admin interface in which a superuser can
remove the locks and rate-limits, which is handy to support learners quickly.


How to Install
--------------
- Install the pip package ``$ pip install -e git+git@github.com:appsembler/unlockerX.git#egg=unlockerx``
- Since the student-specific locks are disabled by default, enable it via
  ``FEATURES['ENABLE_MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS'] = True``. More on `account lockout from edX <https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Optional-Account-lockout-after-excessive-login-failures>`_.
- Migrate and run the server.


How to Use
----------
- Go to ``/admin/unlockerx/``
- Pick either one of ``RateLimitedIP`` or ``StudentAccountLock``
- Select a limit (using the checkbox)
- Click on the action dropdown and remove the limit.

- Make the learner happy!


Monkey Patching
---------------
This module monkey-patches the edX platform in two ways:

- Changes the ``RateLimitMixin.requests`` to 100 to be a bit more permissive for mass-students logging in from
  a shared university IP.
